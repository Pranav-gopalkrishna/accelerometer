Setup procedure:
1. Wire GND pin in accelerometer to Physical Pin 6 (GND) in Raspberry Pi
2. Wire VCC pin in accelerometer to Physical Pin 1 (3V3 i.e. 3.3 Volts Pin) in Raspberry Pi
3. Wire SDA pin in accelerometer to Physical Pin 3 (SDA) in Raspberry Pi
4. Wire SCL pin in accelerometer to Physical Pin 5 (SCL) in Raspberry Pi
